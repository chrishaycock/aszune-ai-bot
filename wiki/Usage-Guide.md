   ```

2. **Reply to the bot**: Reply to one of the bot's messages with your follow-up question

## Conversation Context

The bot maintains a conversation history for each user, allowing it to remember context from previous messages. This enables more coherent and contextual responses over time.

### Managing Your History

If you want to start a new conversation or clear your history:

```
!clearhistory
```

or

```
/clearhistory
```

## Summarizing Conversations

You can ask the bot to summarize your current conversation:

```
!summary
```

or

```
/summary
```

## Summarizing External Text

You can also ask the bot to summarize any text:

```
!summarise <your text here>
```

The bot will generate a concise summary in UK English.

## Viewing Your Stats

To see how many messages you've sent to the bot and how many summaries you've requested:

```
!stats
```

or

```
/stats
```

## Emoji Reactions

The bot will automatically add emoji reactions to your messages based on keywords it detects. For example:
- "hello" might get a üëã reaction
- "funny" might get a üòÑ reaction
- "love" might get a ‚ù§Ô∏è reaction

These reactions are just for fun and help make interactions more engaging.

## Rate Limiting

To prevent spam, the bot enforces a short cooldown period between messages. If you try to send too many messages too quickly, the bot will remind you to wait.

## Best Practices

- Ask clear, specific questions for better results
- Provide context when necessary
- Use the summary feature to keep track of long conversations
- Clear your history when starting a completely new topic
