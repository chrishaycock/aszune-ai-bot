**Aszune AI Bot** is a Discord bot designed to provide gaming lore, game logic, guides, and advice using the Perplexity API with the **sonar** model. It maintains a short conversation history for each user and adds fun emoji reactions based on keywords found in messages. Now supports both traditional `!` commands and modern Discord slash commands.

## Features

- 🤖 **Chat Completions:** Uses Perplexity API's `chat/completions` endpoint with the **sonar** model.
- 🧠 **Context Awareness:** Remembers recent user messages with a configurable history length.
- 🔁 **Command Support:** Users can clear their history at any time.
- 😄 **Emoji Reactions:** Adds reactions based on keywords like "hello", "funny", "love", etc.
- 🔒 **Secure Configuration:** `.env` based token and key management (keeps secrets out of code).
- 🕒 **Rate Limiting:** Prevents users from spamming the bot by enforcing a short cooldown between messages.
- 📝 **Help Command:** `!help` and `/help` commands list all available commands and usage.
- 🧾 **Conversation Summary:** `!summary` and `/summary` commands generate a summary of your current conversation using UK English. (Now robust to API requirements: last message must be from user/tool)
- 📝 **Text Summarisation:** `!summarise <text>` or `!summerise <text>` command generates a summary of any provided text using UK English.
- 🇬🇧 **UK English Responses:** All bot replies and summaries use UK English spelling and phrasing.
- 🗂️ **Improved Performance:** Uses JavaScript `Map` for conversation history and rate limiting for better efficiency and reliability.
- 🛠️ **Cleaner Codebase:** Refactored command handling for easier maintenance and extension.
- 🆕 **Stats Tracking:** `!stats` and `/stats` commands show per-user message and summary counts.
- 🆕 **Slash Command Support:** All major commands are available as Discord slash commands for a modern user experience.
- 🆕 **Smart Answer Cache:** Stores and serves answers to frequently asked questions to reduce API token usage, with robust error handling, question normalization, similarity matching, and automatic refreshing of stale entries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- A Discord bot token (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- A valid [Perplexity AI API key](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrishaycock/aszune-ai-bot.git
   cd aszune-ai-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file**

   ```env
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running the Bot Manually

```bash
node src/index.js
```

You should see:

```
Discord bot is online!
```

Your bot should now appear online in your Discord server.

---

### Running with PM2 (for Production)

PM2 keeps the bot alive in the background and restarts it on crashes or reboots.

#### Option A: Using an Ecosystem File

1. Create a file called `ecosystem.config.js`:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     apps: [
       {
         name: "aszune-ai",
         script: "src/index.js",
         env: {
           DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: "your_discord_bot_token_here",
           PERPLEXITY_API_KEY: "your_perplexity_api_key_here",
         },
       },
     ],
   };
   ```

2. Start your bot:

   ```bash
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   pm2 logs aszune-ai
   ```

#### Option B: Inline Environment Variables

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here pm2 start src/index.js --name aszune-ai
```

## Testing & Coverage

- **Automated Tests:**  
  The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit and integration testing.  
  Run all tests with:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Coverage Reporting:**  
  Code coverage is collected automatically and uploaded to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/chrishaycock/aszune-ai-bot) via GitHub Actions.
  To generate a local coverage report:
  ```bash
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```
  Coverage includes utility modules, command handling, emoji logic, error handling, and more.
- **JUnit Reporting:**  
  Test results are also generated in JUnit XML format, which can be used by CI/CD systems to display test results.
  ```bash
  npm test -- --testResultsProcessor=jest-junit
  ```
- **Codecov Integration:**  
  The project integrates with Codecov for coverage reporting and includes the Codecov AI Reviewer in the CI workflow, which provides automated code reviews on pull requests.

## Troubleshooting

### 🔴 Bot Offline or Invalid Token

- Double-check your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Confirm the token has not been regenerated or revoked
- Ensure your bot has permission to join and read messages in your server

### 🔴 Perplexity API Errors (400 / 401)

- Validate your API key is current and supports the `chat/completions` endpoint
- Ensure model name is `"sonar"` and the format of your payload is correct
- Test the same key using a tool like Postman or curl

---

## Future Enhancements

- [x] Smart caching system for frequently asked questions (implemented)
- [ ] Add clickable sources and reference links from Perplexity results
- [ ] Enhance error handling with retry/backoff logic for API rate limits
- [ ] Web dashboard for usage monitoring and conversation history
- [ ] Implement AI-powered content moderation for safer interactions
- [ ] Admin commands to view cache statistics and manually prune the cache

## Notes

- The codebase has been completely refactored to use a modular structure under the `src/` directory.
- The bot uses a robust command handler for easier extension and maintenance.
- Conversation history and rate limiting are managed using JavaScript `Map` objects for better performance and reliability.
- The `!summarise <text>` command is available for summarising arbitrary text.
- Error handling and environment variable checks have been improved and centralised.
- The bot's system prompt instructs it to say "I don't know" if it cannot answer a question, rather than making up an answer.
